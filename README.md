# Data Structures

This repository contains a collection of basic data structures implemented in C++ for educational purposes and competitive programming.


## seg_tree_max_min_sum

A **Segment Tree** with lazy propagation, designed for performing range queries (maximum, minimum, and sum) efficiently. It is implemented without using advanced data structures or pointers, focusing on simplicity and clarity. Suitable for competitive programming.


## seg_tree_pointers

A **Segment Tree** implementation using pointers, focusing on pointer-based structures to efficiently handle range queries and updates. This version demonstrates the use of pointers for managing the segment tree's nodes.


## simple_heap

A simple **Heap** implementation written purely using functions and vectors. This version avoids the use of classes or complex structures, offering a minimalistic approach to heap operations.
